# Calculator
### A Basic Calculator

In this project, you will use classes, methods, and objects to create a simple arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to:

- Add two integers
- Subtract two integers
- Multiply two integers
- Divide two integers
- Apply the modulo operator on two integers

The instructions provided are general guidelines.

1. Create a public class called ```Calculator```.

2. Inside of the class, create a ```Calculator()``` constructor. You can leave the contents of the constructor empty.

3. Next, create a ```public``` method that returns an ```int``` and call it ```add()```.

4. The ```add()``` method should accept two int parameters. For example: ```int a, int b```.

5. The ```add``` method should add the two integer parameters that a user will specify. Inside of the ```add``` method, return the sum of ```a``` and ```b```.

6. Next, create another similar method called ```subtract()```. The ```subtract()``` method should accept two ```int``` parameters, just like the ```add()``` method does.

7. Inside of the ```subtract()``` method, return the difference of ```a``` and ```b```.

8. Create another method called ```multiply()```. The ```multiply()``` method should accept two ```int``` parameters.

9. Inside of the ```multiply``` method, return the product of ```a``` and ```b```.

10. Create another method called ```divide()```. It should accept two ```int``` parameters.

11. Inside of the ```divide()``` function, return ```a``` divided by ```b```.

12. Create another method called ```modulo```. It should accept two ```int``` parameters.

13. Inside of the ```modulo()``` function, return ```a``` modulo ```b```.

14. Next, create a ```main()``` method. Can you remember all the keywords necessary for a ```main()``` method?

15. Inside of ```main()```, create a ```Calculator``` object called ```myCalculator```.

16. Print out the value of calling the ```add()``` method on ```myCalculator```. Pass in ```5``` and ```7``` as parameters.

17. On the next line, print out the value of calling the ```subtract()``` method on ```myCalculator```. Pass in ```45``` and ```11``` as parameters.

18. If you completed this project correctly, the output should be ```12``` and ```34```. Feel free to explore more with the program. What are some ways in which the program could be improved?

19. Add comments near the top of the program that describe what the program does.
