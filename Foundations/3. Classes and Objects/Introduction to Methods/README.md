# Introduction to Methods

We have made a [SavingsAccount](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/3.%20Classes%20and%20Objects/Introduction%20to%20Methods/SavingsAccount.java) class without using any methods beyond ```main()``` and the constructor, ```SavingsAccount()```.

Run the code to see some account behavior happen.

Look at the main method! Itâ€™s so long! There is so much repeated code! Can you imagine how messy it would look if you needed to make 10 deposits?

Throughout this lesson, we will learn how to make methods that would make checking the balance, depositing, and withdrawing all behavior that would take only one line of code.
