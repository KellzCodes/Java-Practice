# Classes: Syntax

## Shop

1. In a code editor, create a ```public``` ```Store``` class.

2. Your program will not compile without a ```main()``` method.

	Define one within ```Store```.

Example code can be found in the [Store.Java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/3.%20Classes%20and%20Objects/Classes-Syntax/Store.java) file.
