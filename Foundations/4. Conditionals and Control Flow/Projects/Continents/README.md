# Continents Project

Planet Earth is a magical place. Let’s practice the Java switch statement that you learned about.

Write a **Continents.java** program that will print out a continent and the largest city in that continent, based on the value of an integer.

1. Let’s create a skeleton for the program. Add:

```
public class Continents {

  public static void main(String[] args) {



  }

}
```

2. Write a comment near the top of the program that describe what the program does.

3. Create an ```int``` variable called ```continent``` and set it equal to ```4```.

4. Create a ```switch``` statement that will switch based on the value of ```continent```.

5. Inside of the switch statement, add a ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```1```.

6. When the value of ```continent``` is ```1```, print out ```North America: Mexico City, Mexico```.

7. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

8. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```2```. When this value is met, print out ```South America: Sao Paulo, Brazil```.

9. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

10. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```3```. When this value is met, print out ```Europe: Moscow, Russia```. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

11. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```4```. When this value is met, print out ```Africa: Lagos, Nigeria```. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

12. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```5```. When this value is met, print out ```Asia: Shanghai, China```. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

13. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```6```. When this value is met, print out ```Australia: Sydney, Australia```. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

14. Add another ```case``` that will run when the value of ```continent``` is ```7```. When this value is met, print out ```Antarctica: McMurdo Station, US```. Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

15. Finally, add the ```default``` case. The ```default``` case should print out ```Undefined continent!``` Make sure the next line exits out of the case.

16. If the program is written correctly, your output should be ```Africa: Lagos, Nigeria```. Great work!
