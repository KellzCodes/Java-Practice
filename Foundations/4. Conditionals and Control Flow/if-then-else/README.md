# if-then-else

Shows how to use if-then-else statement

1. Start with this code:

```
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    boolean isFilled = false;
    
    // Write an if-then-else statement:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

2. In the code, there is an ```isFilled``` value, that represents whether the order is ready to ship.

	Write an if-then-else statement that:

	- When ```isFilled``` is ```true```, print ```Shipping```.
	- When ```isFilled``` is ```false```, print ```Order not ready```.

Example code can be found in the [Order.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/4.%20Conditionals%20and%20Control%20Flow/if-then-else/Order.java) file.
