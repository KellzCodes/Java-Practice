# If-then

Shows how to use *if-then* statement

1. Start with this code:

```
public class Order {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    double itemCost = 30.99;
    
    // Write an if-then statement:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

2. The code contains an ```Order``` class to track retail shipments.

	Write an ```if-then``` statement that prints ```High value item!``` when ```itemCost``` is greater than ```24.00```.

Example code can be found in the [Order.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/4.%20Conditionals%20and%20Control%20Flow/if-then/Order.java) file.
