# Logical NOT: !

1. Start with this code:

```
public class Reservation {
  int guestCount;
  int restaurantCapacity;
  boolean isRestaurantOpen;
  boolean isConfirmed;
  
  public Reservation(int count, int capacity, boolean open) {
    if (count < 1 || count > 8) {
      System.out.println("Invalid reservation!");
    }
    guestCount = count;
		restaurantCapacity = capacity;
		isRestaurantOpen = open;
  }  
  
  public void confirmReservation() {
    if (restaurantCapacity >= guestCount && isRestaurantOpen) {
      System.out.println("Reservation confirmed");
      isConfirmed = true;
    } else {
      System.out.println("Reservation denied");
			isConfirmed = false;
    }
  }
  
  public void informUser() {
    // Write conditional here

  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Reservation partyOfThree = new Reservation(3, 12, true);
    Reservation partyOfFour = new Reservation(4, 3, true);
    partyOfThree.confirmReservation();
    partyOfThree.informUser();
    partyOfFour.confirmReservation();
    partyOfFour.informUser();
  }
}
```

2. Letâ€™s make ```informUser()``` more informative. If their reservation is not confirmed, they should know!

	Write an ```if-then-else``` statement and use ```!``` with ```isConfirmed``` as the condition.

	If their reservation is **not** confirmed, write ```Unable to confirm reservation, please contact restaurant.```

	Else write: ```Please enjoy your meal!```
