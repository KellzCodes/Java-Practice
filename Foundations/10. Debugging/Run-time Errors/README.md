# Run-time Errors

1. Start with this code

```
public class Debug {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    int width = 0;
    int length = 40;
    
    int ratio = length / width;
    
    System.out.println(ratio);
    
  }
  
}
```

2. There’s a run-time error in **Debug.java**.

	This program is supposed to find the ratio of a table’s dimensions, which is supposed to be 20 x 40.

Example solution can be found in the [Debug.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/10.%20Debugging/Run-time%20Errors/Debug.java) file
