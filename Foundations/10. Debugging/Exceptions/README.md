# Exceptions

1. Start with this code

```
public class Debug {

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    int width = 0;
    int length = 40;
    
    int ratio = length / width;
        
  }
  
}
```

2. Put the code that you think will cause an ```ArithmeticException``` into a ```try``` block.

	Create a ```catch``` block that catches the ```ArithmeticException``` and prints the error message to the terminal.

Example solution can be found in the [Debug.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/10.%20Debugging/Exceptions/Debug.java) file
