# Review

1. Start with this code:

```
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Classroom {
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    
  }
}

```

2. In order to practice the skills you’ve learned throughout the lesson, we’re going to make and use some arrays in the ```main()``` method of a new ```Classroom``` class.

	First, inside ```main()```, make a ```String``` array called ```students```, and set it equal to the following students, in order:
	> Sade
	>
	> Alexus
	>
	> Sam
	>
	> Koma

3. Now, we’re going to store the averages on the most recent math test. Create an array called ```mathScores``` and set it to an empty array of size 4. It should hold ```double```s.

4. Sade got a 94.5 on the test. Store this value in the 0th index of the ```mathScores``` array.

5. Write a print statement to say:

```
	The number of students in the class is <numStudents>.
```

with ```<numStudents>``` replaced by the length of the ```students``` array.


For example, if the array has 7 elements, the printout should read:

```
The number of students in the class is 7.
```
