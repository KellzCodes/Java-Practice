 identifiers and reserved words 
 There are a variety of words used when writing programs that are called identifiers. The identifiers in the King program are class , King , public , static , void , main , String , args , System , out , and println . These fall into three categories:
 - words we create when writing a program (King and args)
 - words that another programmer chose (System, println, out, main, and String)
 - special words used for specific purposes in the language (static, void, class, public)

 We chose to name the program King, but could have used one of many other possibilities. For example, we could have called it TheQuote, Martin, or RightThing.

 The identifier args (short for arguments) is often used the way we used it in King, but we can use almost any other identifier instead.

 The identifiers System, String, out, and print ln were chosen by other programmers. These words aren't apart of the java language. They are apart of the Java standard library of predefined code, a set of classes and methods that someone has already written for us. 

Reserved words are identifiers that have a special meaning in a programmingn language and can only be used in predefined ways. A reserved word cannot be
used for any other purpose, such as naming a class or method. In the King program, the reserved words used are class, public, static, and void. 

Below is a list of all the Java reserved words in alphabetical order. The words marked with an asterisk have been reserved, but currently have no meaning in Java.
