# Incrementing

1. Start with this code

```
class Coffee {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // initialize cupsOfCoffee
    
    // add while loop with counter
    
        
    
  }
  
}
```

2. In **Coffee.java**, initialize an ```int``` variable called ```cupsOfCoffee``` with a value of ```1```.

3. Create a ```while``` loop that runs as long as ```cupsOfCoffee``` is less than or equal to ```100```.

	**Important**: Inside the ```while``` loop, increment ```cupsOfCoffee``` by ```1``` to prevent an infinite loop.

4. Inside the ```while``` loop above where you incremented ```cupsOfCoffee``` print the following:
	> Fry drinks cup of coffee #1

	The 1 in this statement should correspond with the current value of cupsOfCoffee. 

	When cupsOfCoffee is 100, this should be printed:
	> Fry drinks cup of coffee #100
