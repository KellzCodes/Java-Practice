# Fizz Buzz Project

1. Start by creating a skeleton for the program:

	- Create a ```FizzBuzz``` class.
	Inside ```FizzBuzz```, build an empty ```main()``` method.

2. How do we output all the numbers from 1 to 100?

	Well, we could write ```System.out.println()``` 100 times back to back, but that’s no fun. What else can we do?

	That’s right! A ```for``` loop!

	Write a ```for``` loop that starts at 1 and iterates to 100.

3. Inside the ```for``` loop, output the counter ```i```.

4. Run your code — does it print every number between 1 and 100?

```
java FizzBuzz
```

5. Now that we have all the numbers, let’s solve the hard part.

	Before coding further, take out a piece of paper and brainstorm.

	How do we check whether or not a number is divisible by 3? What about for the other two conditions?

	When you are ready, try to implement a solution.
