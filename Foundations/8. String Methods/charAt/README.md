# charAt()

1. Start with this code

```
public class Initials {
  
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    // Add a first name and a last name:
    String firstName = "";  
    String lastName = "";
    
    // What are the initials?
    
    
  }
  
}
```

2. In **Initials.java**, add your first name and last name.

3. Print out the initials of the ```firstName``` and ```lastName```.

Example solution can be found in the [Initials.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/8.%20String%20Methods/charAt/Initials.java) file
