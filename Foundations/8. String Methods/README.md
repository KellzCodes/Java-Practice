# String Methods

As you may recall, a ```String```, which is widely used in Java, is an object that represents a sequence of characters. It is a great way to store information.

Because character strings are so vital to programming, Java dedicated an entire class to them. This is great news for us because the ```String``` class provides a lot of useful methods to help us perform operations on strings and data manipulation.

In this lesson, we will go over several string methods:

- ```length()```
- ```concat()```
- ```equals()```
- ```indexOf()```
- ```charAt()```
- ```substring()```
- ```toUpperCase()``` / ```toLowerCase()```
