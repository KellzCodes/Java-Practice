# equals()

1. Start with this code

```
public class Password {
  
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    
    String password = "correcthorsebatterystaple";
    
    // Write the code:
    
    
  }
  
}
```

2. In **Password.java**, there’s a ```password``` with a value of ```"correcthorsebatterystaple"```.

	Use ```equals()``` to print out whether it’s the same as another string.


Example solution can be found in the [Password.java](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/blob/master/Foundations/8.%20String%20Methods/equals/Password.java) file
