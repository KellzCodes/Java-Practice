# Build Basic Android Apps with Java

## Why Android Development?

### Android Hardware

Hardware is the physical “hard” components of the phone, like the screen, battery, processor and motherboard, or even more obscure hardware devices like accelerometers, gyroscopes, proximity sensors, etc. The software is the intelligence that makes the phone run, manages all of the input/output, and runs the apps (in this case Android).

### Android Software

Software is the intelligence that operates the hardware, manages all of the input/output, and runs the apps. It’s the brain of the device.

### Android Source Code Modification

Because the Android source code is modifiable by companies selling the phones, the actual user interface from device to device will vary as well. Depending on the brand of phone and when it was purchased the default UI may differ.

### Android Software Development Kit

The Android Software Development Kit contains the libraries and tools you need to develop Android Apps.

### Android Studio

Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) created by Google which is used to develop Android apps. Android Studio is a program specifically designed to make developing Android Apps easier, it helps to streamline development, and contains useful tools like a visual layout editor, a debugging suite, and a collection of device emulators to test your apps on. It also has the ability to load your app up on a real android device, and package your app for deployment to the Google Play Store.

### How to Write Android Apps

Android apps are developed in one of two programming languages, either Java or Kotlin. Apps also utilize Extensible Markup Language (XML) which is used to describe data resources, build configuration files, and describe the UI of apps.

### Android Virtual Devices

The Android emulator allows you to run your app on an Android Virtual Device (AVD), which behaves just like a physical Android device. You can set up numerous AVDs, each emulating a different type of device.

### Integrated Development Environment

Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google’s Android operating system, built on JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development. It is available for download on Windows, macOS and Linux based operating systems. It is a replacement for the Eclipse Android Development Tools as the primary IDE for native Android application development.
