# java software solutions 9th edition

- True object-orientation. A text that really teaches a solid object-oriented approach must use what we call object-speak. That is, all processing should be discussed in object-oriented terms. That does not mean, however, that the first program a student sees must discuss the writing of multiple classes and methods. A student should learn to use objects before learning to write
them. This text uses a natural progression that culminates in the ability to design real object-oriented solutions.

- Sound programming practices. Students should not be taught how to program; they should be taught how to write good software. Thereâ€™s a difference. Writing software is not a set of cookbook actions, and a good program is more than a collection of statements. This text integrates
practices that serve as the foundation of good programming skills. These practices are used in all examples and are reinforced in the discussions. Students learn how to solve problems as well as how to implement solutions. We introduce and integrate basic software engineering techniques
throughout the text. The Software Failure vignettes reiterate these lessons by demonstrating the perils of not following these sound practices.

- Examples. Students learn by example. This text is filled with fully implemented examples that demonstrate specific concepts. We have intertwined small, readily understandable examples with larger, more realistic ones. There is a balance between graphics and nongraphics programs.

- Graphics and GUIs. Graphics can be a great motivator for students, and their use can serve as excellent examples of object-orientation. As such, we use them throughout the text in a well-defined set of sections that we call the Graphics Track. This coverage includes the use of event processing and GUIs. Students learn to build GUIs in the appropriate way by using a natural progression of topics. The Graphics Track can be avoided entirely for those who do not choose to use graphics.
