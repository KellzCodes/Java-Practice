In the introduction, we have gone through the concept of a tree and a binary tree.

In this repo, we will focus on the traversal methods used in a binary tree. Understanding these traversal methods will definitely help you have a better understanding of the tree structure and have a solid foundation for the further study.

The goal of this repo is to:

1. Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods;
2. Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal ```recursively```;
3. Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal ```iteratively```;
4. Be able to do ```level traversal``` using ```BFS```.

[Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return *the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.*](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/Binary%20Tree/Traverse%20A%20Tree/Preorder%20Traversal)
