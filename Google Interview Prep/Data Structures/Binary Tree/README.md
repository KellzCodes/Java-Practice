# Binary Tree

## Introduction

A ```tree``` is a frequently-used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree will have a root value and a list of references to other nodes which are called child nodes. From graph view, a tree can also be defined as a directed acyclic graph which has ```N nodes``` and ```N-1 edges```.

A ```Binary Tree``` is one of the most typical tree structure. As the name suggests, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has ```at most two children```, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
