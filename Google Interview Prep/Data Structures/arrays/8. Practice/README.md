## What's Next?

Let's recap what we looked at in this repo:

- We explored what the Array data structure is all about.
- We looked at the Java syntax for creating Arrays.
- We looked at the Java syntax for reading and writing from Arrays.
- We designed basic insertion, deletion, and search algorithms for Arrays.
- We played around with in-place Array algorithms.
- We solved heaps of fun and exciting problems!

What other techniques could there be with Arrays, you might be wondering? Well, wonder no more. Here is a quick taster!

[A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array ```expected``` where ```expected[i]``` is the expected height of the ```ith``` student in line.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Height%20Checker)

[Given a binary array ```nums```, return the maximum number of consecutive ```1```'s in the array if you can flip at most one ```0```.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Max%20Consecutive%20Ones%20II)

[Given integer array ```nums```, return the third maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Third%20Maximum%20Number)

[Given an array ```nums``` of ```n``` integers where ```nums[i]``` is in the range ```[1, n]```, return an array of all the integers in the range ```[1, n]``` that do not appear in ```nums```.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Find%20All%20Numbers%20Disappeared%20in%20an%20Array)

[Given an array of integers ```nums```, calculate the **pivot index** of this array.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Find%20Pivot%20Index)

[Determine whether the largest element in the array is **at least twice** as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return the **index** of the *largest element*, or return ```-1``` otherwise.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Largest%20Number%20At%20Least%20Twice%20of%20Others)

[Given a **non-empty** array of decimal digits representing a non-negative integer, increment one to the integer.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Plus%20One)

[Given an integer array ```nums``` of ```2n``` integers, group these integers into ```n``` pairs ```(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)``` such that the sum of ```min(ai, bi)``` for all ```i``` is **maximized**. Return the *maximized sum*.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Array%20Partition%20I)

[Given an integer array ```nums``` and an integer ```val```, remove all occurrences of ```val``` in ```nums``` in-place. The relative order of the elements may be changed.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Remove%20Element)

[Given an array of positive integers ```nums``` and a positive integer ```target```, return the minimal length of a **contiguous subarray** [numsl, nums<sub>l+1</sub>, ..., nums<sub>r-1</sub>, nums<sub>r</sub>] of which the sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return ```0``` instead.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Minimum%20Size%20Subarray%20Sum)

[Given an integer ```rowIndex```, return the rowIndex<sup>th</sup> (**0-indexed**) row of the **Pascal's triangle**.](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/8.%20Practice/Pascals%20Triangle%20II)
