## What's Next?

Let's recap what we looked at in this repo:

- We explored what the Array data structure is all about.
- We looked at the Java syntax for creating Arrays.
- We looked at the Java syntax for reading and writing from Arrays.
- We designed basic insertion, deletion, and search algorithms for Arrays.
- We played around with in-place Array algorithms.
- We solved heaps of fun and exciting problems!

What other techniques could there be with Arrays, you might be wondering? Well, wonder no more. Here is a quick taster!
