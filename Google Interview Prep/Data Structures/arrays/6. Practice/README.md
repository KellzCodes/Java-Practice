## What's Next?

Let's recap what we looked at in this repo:

- We explored what the Array data structure is all about.
- We looked at the Java syntax for creating Arrays.
- We looked at the Java syntax for reading and writing from Arrays.
- We designed basic insertion, deletion, and search algorithms for Arrays.
- We played around with in-place Array algorithms.
- We solved heaps of fun and exciting problems!

What other techniques could there be with Arrays, you might be wondering? Well, wonder no more. Here is a quick taster!

[You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed). Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays/6.%20Practice/Height%20Checker)
