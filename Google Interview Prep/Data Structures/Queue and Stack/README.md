# Queue & Stack

## Introduction

We may access a ```random``` element by index in [Array](https://github.com/keldavis/Java-Practice/tree/master/Google%20Interview%20Prep/Data%20Structures/arrays). However, we might want to restrict the processing order in some cases.

In this repo, we introduce two different processing orders, ```First-in-First-out``` and ```Last-in-First-out``` and its two corresponding linear data structures, ```Queue``` and ```Stack```.

We go through the definition, implementation and built-in functions for each data structure. Then, we focus more on the practical applications of these two data structures.

By completing this repo, you should be able to:

1. Understand the principle of the processing orders of FIFO and LIFO;
2. Implement these two data structures;
3. Be familiar with the built-in queue and stack structure;
4. Solve basic queue-related problems, especially ```BFS```;
5. Solve basic stack-related problems;
6. Understand how system stack helps you when you solve problems using ```DFS``` and other ```recursion``` algorithms;
